# Titanic-Kaggle Based Machine Learning Task

The first version in 2025/3/4, this is a lab from Machine Learning Workshop. This Lab is used to master and get up with the knowledge of data-preprocessing (e.g numeric data / categorical data / error data / data type / feature engeering / ......).

numeric / categorical different preprocessing methods (scale methods / encoding methods)
empty / null data inside a column
error data inside a column
feature engeering (selection / decide whether to delete certain rows based on multi important columns)
Basic Hyperparameter Tunning (2 basic methods: Grid Search(Cross Validzation) / RandomForest Tunning)
Model Deployment
